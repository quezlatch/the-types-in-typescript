# The Types in TypeScript

Example code for talk

The idea is that we take a small example piece of JavaScript and gradually introduce more type features
from TypeScript to improve the domain model.

The snippits are:

* [vanilla Javascript](index.js)
* [basic type](index1.ts)
* [union types](index2.ts)
* [type alias primitives](index3.ts) (this is a trick exercise)
* [tagged types](index4.ts)
* [use taghiro for tagged types](index5.ts)
* [add constraints to tagged types](index6.ts)
* [types can be verbs as well as nouns](index7.ts)
* [example builder type](index8.ts)

The typescript snippits have compile errors, and the idea is by correcting them you will gradually
move towards making illegal states unrepresentable.
